# News Images Setup

## Required Image

To complete the news page design, you need to save the brown textured background image as:

**File name:** `news-card-bg.jpg`
**Location:** `public/news-card-bg.jpg`

This is the brown textured background shown in the second image you provided. Save it in the public folder with the exact name above.

## Directory Structure

```
public/
├── news-card-bg.jpg  (← Save the brown textured background here)
└── news/             (← Optional: folder for individual news images)
```

## Steps to Add the Image

1. Save the second image you provided (brown textured background) 
2. Rename it to: `news-card-bg.jpg`
3. Place it in the `public/` folder
4. The news cards will automatically use this background

Once added, the page will display correctly with the brown textured background on each card.
